         <p>A news letter is a publication with a paper cover which is issused regularly twice a
year and which contains unique idea of people. It may be a articles, stories, photography,
advertisements etc., Usually, a article is between 1,000 and 5,000 words, either short or
long, depending on the subject. Newspaper reporters are trained to give the most important
points first in a news story. However, articles often begin with a tantalizing mystery,
question or scenario to hook the reader into reading the entire article. Moreover, newspaper
reports are objective records of events while magazine articles, often subjective, deal with
a specific subject, and take a specific angle or point of view.</p>
